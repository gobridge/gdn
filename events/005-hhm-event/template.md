We are extremely excited to announce our fifth GDN Event: Celebrating Hispanic Gophers as part of Hispanic Heritage Month! During the event you will hear from three fellow gophers, Guillermo Galvan, Dario Castañé, and Luis Giovanny Carreno Ortiz, based in Mexico, Spain, and Colombia. They will be speaking about how to build a k8s operator with Go for a Machine Learning App, breaking Docker, and the wonderful simplicity of Go when learning computer science and programming.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

All talks will be recorded and streamed on the GDN YouTube Channel https://youtube.com/c/GoDevNet

Featured Talks:

\* Talk 1: Build a k8s operator with Go for a Machine Learning App

Speaker: Guillermo Galvan

In this talk, I am going to share about extending kubernetes with Go, in addition to interacting with a Machine Learning application example.

\* Talk 2: Oops - I broke Docker. A story about maintaining github.com/imdario/mergo

Speaker: Dario Castañé

Releasing code in the open is an act of kindness. You help to scratch the same itch you had. But you don't know who will use this code. Mine ended in the heart of the cloud: containers. Mergo is a small library used to merge structs used by Docker, Kubernetes, and other big projects. And, because of one teeny tiny mistake, I broke a released version of Docker. This talk is the story of what happened and what lessons I learned.

\* Talk 3: Go's simplicity and its approach to the learning of computer sciences and programming.

Speaker: Luis Giovanny Carreno Ortiz

The simplicity of the Go programming language can help us to understand hard computer science topics in a better way. In this talk, Luis will be sharing his experiences in learning Go and sharing with us how it helped him strengthen his understanding of topics found while studying computer science and programming. An experience he thinks is unique to the language that can help us all learn.
