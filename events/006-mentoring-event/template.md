Featured Talks:

Exercism is designed to help you get really good at programming. Built around a system of self-directed learning, practice and mentoring, it offers a unique way to master a language you know or pick up a new language. Exercism focuses on developing fluency by mastering the idioms of a programming language and is centered around mentor-feedback. When students solve exercises they send their code to our volunteer community of mentors, who provide feedback on their work, highlighting knowledge gaps and areas for improvement. Exercism is 100% free, open-source and underpinned by a not-for-profit organisation.

Speaker: Jeremy Walker

In this talk, Jeremy Walker of Exercism will provide a walk through of the platform and share with everyone how they can get started being a mentee, mentor, and content creator.
