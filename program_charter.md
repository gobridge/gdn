## Program Charter
The GDN is a collection of Go user groups working together with a shared mission to empower developer communities with the knowledge, experience, and wisdom to build the next generation of software in Go. This network creates a single place to search for local Gopher groups, workshops, and events.

### Key Initiatives
---
### Meetup Pro Services
The GDN revolves around meetup groups; its main focus is to help bring together existing and new Go user groups for the community to participate in. The GDN (https://www.meetup.com/pro/go/) currently has 102 groups spread across 51 countries, with over 90,000+ members. To bring our Go user groups together, we ask all active groups to join the GDN pro meetup account, where we cover all meetup fees and provide Zoom meeting support.

Our goal is to make it easy for new groups to be discovered within the Go community and provide them with resources to be successful.

#### Tasks include:

* Assist with group registrations to the GDN, which involves adding new members, tracking active meetups for existing members, and managing group membership.
* Regularly communicate with meetup groups to see how we can help engage their communities; this is important for groups with large memberships but low activity.
* Build tooling and processes to help survey groups that are doing well or are in need.
* Maintain the FAQs and relevant content with the GDN GitHub repository https://github.com/gobridge/gdn/


### Local Meetup Events
Once a group is active, it takes work to coordinate speakers, venues, and food for events. The GDN would like to encourage local groups, where possible, to host regular in-person meetups every month. We are shooting for monthly to help keep engagement active, but we are aware that may not always be possible.

Our goal is to have ambassadors work with one or more local groups to help find speakers and venues to host local meetups. Depending on the locality of the ambassador getting details on local sponsorship may require working with the local meetup organizers to establish relationships with local businesses that can help support.

#### Tasks include:
* Establish a relationship with one or more local meetups that you can assist in setting up events. Work to understand the needs of the local groups.
* Set up a process where local meetups in need can open an issue to request speakers, venues, or other resources for their upcoming events.
* Work with the GDN team and our network to find speakers for local groups in need.
* Help meetup groups set up remote Zoom sessions.

### Local Workshops
Like the local meetup events, the GDN would like to encourage groups to offer hands-on workshops; at least twice a year if possible. There is a lot of great content in the community on using Go, which sometimes people find hard to practice without some guided help; this is where workshops come in.

Our goal here is to work with community content creators to build up a set of resources for local workshops. This work overlaps with the local meetup events work for finding venues, providing instructors, and budgeting for the workshop.

#### Tasks include:
* Establish relationships with content creators to help identify what resources that can be made available for free local workshops. Some creators may offer to donate a one-time pass.
* Set up a process where local meetups can request help when setting up a workshop.
* Work with the GDN team and local organizers to find relevant content for local workshops. We should follow the process in https://github.com/gobridge/workshops
